What makes a good headline? Get instant headline analysis based on readability, length, and powerwords. 

== Description ==

HeadlineEngine is part of a suite of tools for news publishers, built by [MavEngine](https://mavengine.com), a division of [Daily Maverick](https://dailymaverick.co.za). 

It analyses your headline as you type it and provides a score, based on the readability (how complex it is), length (how long it is), and powerwords (how many words it contains).

_Note: This plugin only works in the Classic Editor. We will have a version for Gutenberg soon._

== Features ==

= Readability =

We use the [Flesch Kincaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) formula to calculate readability. A good range of not too complex or too simple would be between 45 and 90. This is configurable in the system.

= Length =

You should aim for a letter count in the low-80s, which is about 12 words. We recommend between 40 and 90 characters. This is configurable in the system.

= Powerwords =

Powerwords are emotional words. You can set your own, or use the words from [RankMath](https://rankmath.com/blog/power-words/).
